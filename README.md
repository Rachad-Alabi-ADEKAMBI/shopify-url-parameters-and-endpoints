# Shopify URL parameters

When using Shopify URLs, the following query parameters can modify how the page is displayed or behaves:

* `?_fd=0`: Prevents domain forwarding, ensuring the URL remains unchanged when navigating between Shopify and your custom domain.
* `?pb=0`: Hides the Shopify preview bar, providing a cleaner view of the page, useful for screenshots or sharing the page without the preview tools visible.
